Believe: Know that the problem you have identified has a solution, and trust that you and your team can build something to address it.

Understand: Take the time to learn about the experience of the people affected by this problem / who will be using your solution – what does their journey look like? What are their pain points? What factors are affecting how they operate in / engage with the world?

Invent: Create a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to test out an idea that you have! Be sure to keep in mind how your “invention” will meet your users’ needs.

Listen: Get feedback from your users on your MVP / prototype and modify it as needed.

Deliver: Continue to deliver refined versions of your MVP / prototype and improve it over time!
